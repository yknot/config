## [Script](https://gist.github.com/yknot/c5d2c3094f15c0ecea5d)
In this gist is a super modified version of a mac setup script written by [Brandon Brown](https://gist.github.com/brandonb927/3195465). The original script does a lot of modifications which I thought were unnecessary but might have to refer back to in the future.
